# BlazingFast DoS method (updated 2022)
The previous method I posted has been patched, this one has not been. You can modify this script or implement it in order to use bots to take down a BlazingFast VPS. BlazingFast is known for being a relatively good host, and with my own experience, has a good team.

## How does it work?
BlazingFast protects all its virtual private servers with very good mitigation and detection methods, this script bypasses them by pretending to be a whitelisted crawling bot (BlazingFast use them to crawl servers for statistics such as avg heat, avg net use, etc) and succeeds in sending enough traffic to
knock down a single server its aimed at.

**Use it whilst it still works.**
